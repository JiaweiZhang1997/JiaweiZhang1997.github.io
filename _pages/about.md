# Welcome!
I am currently a research assistant at [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/), Prof. [Fajie Yuan's Lab](https://github.com/westlake-repl). And the main work direction is AI4Science.

I graduated from the School of Economics and Management of [Civil Aviation University of China](https://www.cauc.edu.cn/en/) in 2020.

From 2022-2024, I worked with Dr. [Hui Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LlcLoysAAAAJ) at [Fresh Wind Biotechnologies, Inc.](https://www.freshwindbiotech.com/) and was mainly responsible for algorithm development for cellular immunotherapy. 

My research interest includes **natural language processing and AI4Science (especially proteins and cancer)**.

You can find my CV here: [Jiawei Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/jwzhang_CV.pdf)

# üñ•Ô∏è Project

**An LLM-based biological agent**

Developer and researcher, supervised by Prof. [Fajie Yuan](https://fajieyuan.github.io/)

- Design and develop an LLM-based agent system that automatically executes corresponding AI  models and bioinformatic tools based on the user's needs. 



[SaprotHub: Making Protein Modeling Accessible to All Biologists](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.24.595648v3)  [github repository]([westlake-repl/SaprotHub: SaprotHub: Making Protein Modeling Accessible to All Biologists (github.com)](https://github.com/westlake-repl/SaprotHub))

Assistant Developer, supervised by Prof. [Fajie Yuan](https://fajieyuan.github.io/)

- Developed ColabSaprot and SaprotHub to support scientific research, allowing biologists to easily train and use Protein Language Models. SaprotHub is widely used for protein-related tasks, with wet lab experiments validating its results.



**An LLM-based web3 agent**

Researcher, supervised by Prof. [Youzhi Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=i2j5DmwAAAAJ).

- Design an agent that can decompose user requirements and then select and execute the appropriate  tool for each step of the task.

  

**TCR-pMHC Binding prediction base on transfer learning** [github repository](https://github.com/Freshwind-Bioinformatics/TABR-BERT)

Developer and researcher, supervised by Dr. [Hui Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LlcLoysAAAAJ)

- Predict the binding of TCR peptide-MHC-1 complexes by BERT-based deep learning model with  transfer learning.



**Neoantigens identification base on multi-task learning** [github repository]([Freshwind-Bioinformatics/NeoMUST: NeoMUST: an Accurate and Efficient Multi-Task Learning Model for Neoantigen Presentation (github.com)](https://github.com/Freshwind-Bioinformatics/NeoMUST))

Developer and researcher, supervised by Dr. [Hui Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LlcLoysAAAAJ)

- Accurate identification of neoantigens by multi-task learning architecture with LSTM as the feature  extractor.
